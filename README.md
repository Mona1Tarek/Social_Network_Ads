# Social Network Ads - A Simple Logistic Regression Project for User Action Prediction

## Project Description

This project aims to predict whether a user will click on an advertisement on a social networking platform based on their demographic and activity data. The goal is to help businesses better target their ads, improve user engagement, and optimize marketing efforts. Logistic regression is used as the primary machine learning model due to its effectiveness in binary classification problems like this one.

### Key Components:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset by handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the data into training and test sets.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Analyzing and selecting the most relevant features from the dataset to enhance the performance of the logistic regression model.
3. **Model Development**: Using logistic regression to build a binary classifier that predicts whether a user will click on an ad based on their demographic and activity data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.


## Project Structure:
- **data/**: Contains the raw and processed datasets used for training and testing the model.
- **models/**: Stores the trained logistic regression model.
- **notebooks/**: Includes Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and feature selection.
- **src/**: Contains the scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
